## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Indian Premier League (IPL). I have analyzed match results, the impact of toss decisions, and individual player performances (both Batting & Bowling) using comprehensive datasets spanning from 2008 to 2024.

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations

### 1. Most Successful Players (Man of the Match)
This analysis identifies the players who have dominated IPL history by winning the maximum number of 'Player of the Match' awards.
